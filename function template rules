(order matters)
1. Function template name lookup (involves argument dependant lookup) - method when a name is "parsed by the parser"(maybe) is 
   associated with the declaration that introduces it.
   argument dependant lookup (ADL, Koenig lookup) -> is set of rules for looking up the unqualified function names in function call expr's.

2. template argument deduction - method of detecting the exact type of the template (type) arguments

3. template argument substuition(SFINAE) - After the arguments are deduced, now we have to substuition the template deduced types in 
   the correct context, if the deduced template arguments are not fitted in the context it is substuition failure (not error), reduced 
   from possible overload sets
