Project idea: 
Implement an EDSL to specify placement for Components.
Similar to domain maps 
and write allocators over domain maps to use with standard containers. 
Steps:

 1.  Look for allocator implementation in BOOST,THRUST, or similar..
 2.  Try to fit domain maps inside allocator - allocator parameters maybe (localities, Policy -such as block, cyclic)
 3.  Write simple container from that allocators. 
 4.  Don't know about EDSL : (
